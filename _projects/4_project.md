### | Goal of project

- Build a predictive model that can identify the severity of claim early in the claim life cycle.

### | Contribution

- Created a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) template in R that describes business problems with the data and presents key performance indicators 
- Visualized indemnity and expense payments and their relationship with the claim life cycle using ggplot2 in R
- Proficiently managed and analyzed large datasets (> 720,000 records) stored on AWS S3 using R
- Created a diagram of the claim process to link EDA results to business processes

### | Impact 
- Significantly reduced time and effort required for EDA in future claim severity projects
