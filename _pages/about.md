Hello! Welcome to my portfolio!

I am a **Data Scientist** at Nationwide and a **PhD candidate in Psychology** at the Ohio State University.

During my PhD, I studied **how people make decisions based on their preferences**. I uncovered the mechanisms behind preference-based decisions using the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM). The DDM is **a mathematical model that addresses binary classification and linear regression together**. 

As a Data Scientist at Nationwide, I leverage my expertise in data analytics to help Nationwide make data-driven decisions. My work ranges **from data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to predictive modeling**. 

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/minheeyoo">**<u>LinkedIn</u>**</a>!
